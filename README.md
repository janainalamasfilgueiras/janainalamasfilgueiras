## 🚀 About Me

As a PMP® certified Project Manager and Scrum Master, I specialize in leading complex, cross-functional projects using Agile, Hybrid, and Waterfall methodologies. With over 10 years of experience across technology, telecom, education, and cybersecurity sectors, I excel at driving results with efficiency and clarity—always keeping the customer at the center.

Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in **Data Analysis at Laboratória** through a hands-on bootcamp, integrating data-driven decision-making even further.

My journey is defined by a multidisciplinary approach, connecting strategic planning, KPIs/OKRs management, and digital transformation. I’m passionate about leveraging insights to optimize processes and deliver high-impact outcomes—whether working with remote, on-site, or multicultural teams.
